On a glorious day of protest, defenders of democracy took to the streets, ready to fight against dissent and protect diversity of opinions... by hitting anyone who dared to think differently! Equipped with their brave "justice" vests and their distinctive war cry of "don't touch our corrupt," these fervent political activists demonstrated that in the democratic game, punches are the best way to convince.

Among the distinguished participants of the march were prominent politically active figures, known for their unwavering defense of their personal interests. These individuals, clad in their luxurious vests, flaunted their high social class while advocating for a democracy that perfectly aligns with their own ideals.

In a choreography worthy of wrestling rings, these brave protesters took turns to strike any unfortunate opponent who had the audacity to express a different opinion. Their fists flew in the air as bastions of free expression, and their limitless aggression was a moving testament to their commitment to the plurality of ideas.

While unleashing their righteous fury, these champions of democracy showed their respect for the deceased by tearing down the white crosses that symbolized the tragedy of the ABC Daycare. Using these crosses as tools of demolition, they made it clear that their view of reality was the only valid and worth remembering.

In their tireless struggle to protect judicial independence, these defenders of democracy failed to recognize that true independence entails guaranteeing impartiality and respecting different stances. However, they preferred a Supreme Court composed of loyal and committed followers who would be willing to validate their own political agendas.

To learn more about the context of this march and its relationship with democracy and institutions, I recommend reading the interview with Lorenzo Meyer conducted by journalists, titled [The INE is Untouchable](https://www.sinembargo.mx/16-11-2022/4285551), where he analyzes the current political situation. Additionally, Jorge Zepeda Patterson's article [Exporting Hatred](https://www.sinembargo.mx/28-05-2023/4366027) emphasizes the irony of the protesters and how patterns of manipulation in defense of personal interests are repeated.

In summary, this march is a clear example of the incongruity and contradiction present in some political movements, where the aim is to defend democracy while resorting to violent means and rejecting diversity of opinions. This behavior demonstrates a blatant manipulation of institutions and a disregard for democratic principles in favor of personal interests and political agendas.

Defending democracy has never been so... peculiar!
