On a glorious day of protest, defenders of democracy took to the streets, ready to fight against dissent and protect the diversity of opinions... by beating up anyone who dared to think differently! Equipped with their courageous "justice" vests and their distinctive war cry of "don't touch our corrupt ones," these fervent political activists demonstrated that in the game of democracy, violence is the best way to persuade.

Among the illustrious participants of the march were prominent politically active figures, known for their unwavering defense of their personal interests. These individuals, clad in their luxury vests, flaunted their upper-class status while advocating for a democracy that perfectly aligns with their own ideals.

In a choreography worthy of wrestling rings, these brave protesters took turns to beat up any unfortunate opponent who had the audacity to express a different opinion. Their fists flew in the air as symbols of free expression, and their boundless aggression was a touching testament to their commitment to the plurality of ideas.

While unleashing their righteous fury, these champions of democracy showed their respect for the deceased by tearing down the white crosses symbolizing the tragedy of the ABC Daycare. Using these crosses as demolition tools, they made it clear that their vision of reality was the only valid and worthy one to be remembered.

In their tireless struggle to protect judicial independence, these defenders of democracy failed to realize that true independence entails ensuring impartiality and respecting different viewpoints. However, they preferred a Supreme Court composed of loyal and committed followers who would be willing to validate their own political agendas.

Additionally, Jorge Zepeda Patterson emphasizes the irony of the protesters and the recurring patterns of manipulation in defense of personal interests in his article [The Vest March and Political Incongruity](https://www.sinembargo.mx/28-05-2023/4366027).

In summary, this march is a clear example of the incongruity and contradiction present in some political movements, where they claim to defend democracy while resorting to violent means and rejecting diversity of opinions. This behavior demonstrates a clear manipulation of institutions and a disregard for democratic principles in favor of personal interests and political agendas.

Defending democracy has never been so... peculiar!
