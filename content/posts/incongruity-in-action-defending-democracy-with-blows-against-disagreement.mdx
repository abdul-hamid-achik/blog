  alt="The open triptych includes three scenes. The left panel is dedicated to Paradise, with the creation of Eve and the Fountain of Life, while the right panel depicts Hell. The central panel gives the ensemble its name, representing the delights or pleasures of life in a garden. Between Paradise and Hell, these delights are nothing but allusions to Sin, portraying humanity indulging in various worldly pleasures. The representations of Lust, with its strong erotic charge, are evident, along with other more enigmatic meanings. Through the fleeting beauty of flowers or the sweetness of fruits, a message of fragility is conveyed, emphasizing the ephemeral nature of happiness and the enjoyment of pleasure. This is seemingly corroborated by certain groups, such as the couple enclosed in a glass sphere on the left side, possibly alluding to the Flemish proverb: 'Happiness is like glass, it breaks quickly.' The closed triptych depicts in grisaille the third day of the creation of the World, with God the Father as the Creator, as inscribed on each panel: 'He said it himself, and it was done' and 'He ordered it himself, and it was created' Genesis (1:9-13). A moralizing work, it is one of Bosch's most enigmatic, complex, and beautiful creations, executed in the final stage of his life. Acquired in the auction of the prior don Fernando, natural son of the great Duke of Alba, Philip II took it to El Escorial in 1593."

_üá≥üá± Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights (1503-1504)_

In the vast world of art, we sometimes come across works that challenge us to reflect on the complexity of the human condition and the inherent contradictions of our society. The artwork at hand, titled "The Battle of Ideas," is no exception. In this masterpiece, the artist has managed to capture the essence of incongruity and invites us to explore its deeper meaning.

The artwork presents a tumultuous scene where diverse characters, clad in vibrant vests, confront each other in a visually striking clash. In this painting, the battle is not fought with swords or shields but with ideas and words that collide in a whirlwind of expressive gestures.

At first glance, we can appreciate the irony present in the scene: those who claim to defend democracy and diversity of opinions seem determined to silence any dissident voice. Incongruity unfolds before our eyes as the characters engage in a verbal combat, using their supposed fight for democracy as a justification to suppress disagreements and promote their own worldview.

This artwork challenges us to ponder the nature of incongruity and how it can manifest in the political and social realm. It urges us to question the authenticity of those who present themselves as defenders of democracy but adopt violent and closed attitudes towards those who do not share their ideals. How can we interpret this paradox? What does it reveal about the inherent contradictions of our society and the human condition?

On a glorious day of protest, defenders of democracy took to the streets, ready to fight against disagreement and protect the diversity of opinions... by beating anyone who dared to think differently! Equipped with their brave "justice" vests and their distinctive war cry of "hands off our corrupt ones," these fervent political activists demonstrated that in the game of democracy, punches are the best form of persuasion.

Among the illustrious participants in the march were prominent politically active figures, recognized for their unwavering defense of their personal interests. These individuals, adorned in their luxurious vests, flaunted their high social class while advocating for a democracy that perfectly aligns with their own ideals.

In a choreography worthy of wrestling rings, these brave protesters took turns to strike any unfortunate opponent who had the audacity to express a different opinion. Their fists flew in the air as bastions of free expression, and their boundless aggression was a moving testament to their commitment to the plurality of ideas.

While unleashing their righteous fury, these champions of democracy demonstrated their respect for the deceased by tearing down the white crosses symbolizing the tragedy of the ABC Daycare Fire. Using these crosses as demolition tools, they made it clear that their perception of reality was the only valid one worth remembering.

In their tireless fight to protect judicial independence, these defenders of democracy failed to realize that true independence entails ensuring impartiality and respecting different viewpoints. Instead, they preferred a Supreme Court composed of loyal and committed followers who would be willing to validate their own political agendas.

To delve deeper into the context of this march and its relationship with democracy and institutions, we recommend reading Lorenzo Meyer's article, [The Exportation of Hatred](https://www.sinembargo.mx/28-05-2023/4366027), where he analyzes the current political situation. Additionally, Jorge Zepeda Patterson, in his article [The March of Chalecos and Political Incongruity](https://www.sinembargo.mx/28-05-2023/4366027), emphasizes the irony of the protesters and how patterns of manipulation repeat in the defense of personal interests.

In summary, this march is a clear example of the incongruity and contradiction present in some political movements, where the defense of democracy is sought while using violent means and rejecting diversity of opinions. This behavior shows a clear manipulation of institutions and a disregard for democratic principles in favor of personal interests and political agendas.

Defending democracy has never been so... peculiar!
