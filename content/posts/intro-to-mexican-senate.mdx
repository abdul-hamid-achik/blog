In a recent display that resembled a high school reunion more than a Senate session, Mexico's opposition senators decided to transform the Senate floor into their personal stage, complete with banners and grandstanding. There's a time for theatricals, of course, but one might argue that it is not when serious legislation hangs in the balance.

On Thursday, a crucial session of the Mexican Senate was held to discuss the appointment of a commissioner for the National Institute for Transparency, Access to Information and Personal Data Protection (INAI). But, alas, it was not to be. The opposition senators, in their infinite wisdom, decided to play an elaborate game of "Simon Says" instead, where Simon is whoever shouts the loudest.

The session was expected to confirm Ricardo Salgado Perrilliat, a technically capable and experienced candidate, to fill one of the three vacancies at INAI. Morena, the ruling party, despite allegedly agreeing to the nomination, shockingly voted against it. Instead of discussing and negotiating like mature parliamentarians, the opposition senators decided to occupy the rostrum, displaying banners with such profound slogans as "Commissioners, Now!" and "INAI today!".

In response to this political melodrama, the Senate President, Alejandro Armenta of Morena, had to announce a recess. With the opposition's makeshift sit-in, the Senate floor turned into a kind of political slumber party. Twenty vital issues, including initiatives promoted by President LÃ³pez Obrador, were left in limbo, a sad casualty of the opposition's playground antics.

What's more, this was the last session before a four-month recess, making it crucial to fill at least one of the INAI commissioner vacancies. But it appears that the opposition senators didn't quite get the memo. Too busy waving their banners and shouting slogans, they seem to have forgotten that their job is to discuss and pass legislation, not to rehearse for their next school play.

The opposition senators were quick to point fingers, accusing Morena of deceit. They claimed that they would stay put until Sunday if necessary. It's heartening to see such dedication, isn't it? One can only wish that they channeled this relentless energy into something productive, like, say, passing legislation.

These senators have indeed vowed to block any Morena reforms until an INAI commissioner is appointed. In their minds, nothing screams "commitment to transparency and accountability" like halting progress on other important reforms. It's like refusing to pay your electricity bill until the tap in the bathroom is fixed. It doesn't quite add up, does it?

Perhaps next time, our esteemed opposition senators will remember that they're in the Senate to serve the people, not to stage dramatic protests. But who knows? Maybe they'll decide to bring a marching band next time. After all, it's all just a grand spectacle, right?
