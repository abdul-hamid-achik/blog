## English

The city, like a hungry dog  
Runs after me wherever I go  
When nature died of cancer  
You buried it and shouted: "Good!"

You shouted: "Bitter!"

They kissed in the trash cans  
They took cars on credit and crashed  
And vodka flooded new buildings  
Bombs exploded in Volgograd at the station!

And the stars froze in fear!  
And white powder fell from the sky  
And the city, like a hungry dog  
Runs after me wherever I go


## Analysis

### The City and its Carnivorous Nature

The song illustrates a city that chases the speaker relentlessly, much like a famished dog. This paints a picture of a city that is desperate, relentless, and dangerous. The metaphor hints at an overwhelming and oppressive urban existence where peace and escape seem unattainable.

_üá©üá™ Ernst Ludwig Kirchner - Berliner Stra√üenszene (Ernst Ludwig Kirchner - Berlin Street Scene) (1913)_

Ernst Ludwig Kirchner's "Berliner Stra√üenszene" (Berlin Street Scene) encapsulates this restless urban energy. The scene depicted in the painting is frenetic and chaotic, mirroring the persistent city in the song. The city, teeming with life, appears to be in a state of constant movement, reflecting the relentless pursuit described in the song.

### Death of Nature and Despair

The song describes the death of nature due to cancer, a metaphor for the detrimental effects of human activity on the environment. It portrays a world where the destruction of nature is met with cheers of "Good!" and "Bitter!", revealing a disturbing indifference towards the planet's demise.

_üá©üá™ Caspar David Friedrich - Der Wanderer √ºber dem Nebelmeer (Caspar David Friedrich - Wanderer above the Sea of Fog) (1818)_

In stark contrast to this bleak depiction, Caspar David Friedrich's "Der Wanderer √ºber dem Nebelmeer" (Wanderer above the Sea of Fog) presents an individual standing above a vast, untouched natural landscape. The painting resonates with the song's narrative, representing the beautiful natural world that is now lost, as mentioned in the song. The solitary figure could symbolize the individual in the song, surveying the damage inflicted upon the natural world.

### Fear and Destruction

The song expresses a sense of fear and impending doom, with references to bombs exploding and stars freezing in fear. It portrays a world teetering on the edge of catastrophe, with no sign of respite or relief.

_üá™üá∏ Pablo Picasso - Guernica (Pablo Picasso - Guernica) (1937)_

Pablo Picasso's "Guernica" shares this theme of destruction and fear. The painting, a response to the bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War, is a haunting depiction of the horrors of war. Its chaotic and fragmented imagery parallels the song's description of a world on the brink of disaster.
