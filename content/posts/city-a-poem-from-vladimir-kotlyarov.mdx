There is a certain peculiar emptiness that follows therapy, a void that is paradoxically filled with echoes of newly surfaced memories. As I found myself on Montevideo avenue, a pulsating vein in Guadalajara's Providencia neighborhood, I selected a song on my phone - a poem by Vladimir Kotlyarov. Suddenly, the cityscape around me transformed into a living, breathing embodiment of this verse.

The city, in all its chaotic glory, unfolded before me like a hungry dog, relentless and insatiable. We, its inhabitants, each confined to our own spheres of existence, were nonetheless bound together by this shared, urban predicament. Despite the solitude that clung to me, I found a strange sense of solidarity in the city's ceaseless rhythm, its problems mirroring the traumas that therapy had unearthed.

As I journeyed down the avenue, the city and the verse wove themselves into the fabric of my recollections - memories, both painful and cathartic, that had been stirred awake in the preceding session. Each corner, each passing face, each murmur of the city seemed to resonate with my personal narrative, forming a surreal backdrop to the labyrinth of my thoughts.

In a previous endeavor, ["The Gambler and the Black Square"](https://www.abdulachik.dev/posts/the-gambler-and-the-black-square), I had navigated a book through the interpretive lens of several paintings. Now, I found myself on a similar journey, using the works of renowned painters to illuminate the layers of Kotlyarov's poem.

What follows is my exploration of this intertwining of city life, personal memories, and the haunting verses of the song. It is an ode to shared human experiences and a contemplation of the city as seen through the eyes of an introspective wanderer. Through this analysis, I hope to provide a window into our collective experience, the pulsating heart of the city, and a sense of solace in the face of alienation.

As I made my way home, where my beautiful pugylove and the city awaited, with all its complexity, seemed a little less alien, a little more like a companion on this solitary journey. And perhaps, dear reader, you too will find a touch of companionship in this exploration, a resonance in your own solitary walk through the labyrinth of life.

## Analysis

### The City and its Carnivorous Nature

The song illustrates a city that chases the speaker relentlessly, much like a famished dog. This paints a picture of a city that is desperate, relentless, and dangerous. The metaphor hints at an overwhelming and oppressive urban existence where peace and escape seem unattainable.

_ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Ernst Ludwig Kirchner - Berlin Street Scene (1913)_

Ernst Ludwig Kirchner's "Berliner StraÃŸenszene" (Berlin Street Scene) encapsulates this restless urban energy. The scene depicted in the painting is frenetic and chaotic, mirroring the persistent city in the song. The city, teeming with life, appears to be in a state of constant movement, reflecting the relentless pursuit described in the song.

### Death of Nature and Despair

The song describes the death of nature due to cancer, a metaphor for the detrimental effects of human activity on the environment. It portrays a world where the destruction of nature is met with cheers of "Good!" and "Bitter!", revealing a disturbing indifference towards the planet's demise.

_ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Caspar David Friedrich - Wanderer above the Sea of Fog (1818)_

In stark contrast to this bleak depiction, Caspar David Friedrich's "Der Wanderer Ã¼ber dem Nebelmeer" (Wanderer above the Sea of Fog) presents an individual standing above a vast, untouched natural landscape. The painting resonates with the song's narrative, representing the beautiful natural world that is now lost, as mentioned in the song. The solitary figure could symbolize the individual in the song, surveying the damage inflicted upon the natural world.

### Fear and Destruction

The song expresses a sense of fear and impending doom, with references to bombs exploding and stars freezing in fear. It portrays a world teetering on the edge of catastrophe, with no sign of respite or relief.

_ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Pablo Picasso - Guernica (1937)_

Pablo Picasso's "Guernica" shares this theme of destruction and fear. The painting, a response to the bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War, is a haunting depiction of the horrors of war. Its chaotic and fragmented imagery parallels the song's description of a world on the brink of disaster.

## Lyrics

The city, like a hungry dog  
Runs after me wherever I go  
When nature died of cancer  
You buried it and shouted: "Good!"

You shouted: "Bitter!"

They kissed in the trash cans  
They took cars on credit and crashed  
And vodka flooded new buildings  
Bombs exploded in Volgograd at the station!

And the stars froze in fear!  
And white powder fell from the sky  
And the city, like a hungry dog  
Runs after me wherever I go

ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Thank you for reading
