_🇵🇱 Jan Matejko - Stańczyk at a dance in the court of Queen Bona after the loss of Smolensk (1862)_

It has been a while since I stopped to contemplate this painting by Jan Matejko, Stanczyk. Although I often choose paintings and reflect on them in my writings, I don't want you to get the idea that I'm an art analyst. However, I would like to someday call myself one. What I often think and believe I am is a jester.

This painting deeply impacts me. Stanczyk, as you can see, is sitting with his back to the party that seems to be happening behind him. Despite his role as a jester, whose purpose is to entertain and bring joy to others, he himself is unable to find happiness. Why is Stanczyk able to bring joy to others but cannot bring joy to himself?

According to many analyses I found on the internet and various blogs, Stanczyk seems to be affected by the capture of the city of Smolensk by the Russian Empire. Jan Matejko, an extremely intelligent Pole like Stanczyk, painted this piece, which could potentially be a self-portrait, showing how deeply Stanczyk is affected by the capture of Smolensk while the Polish elite appears indifferent and celebrates.

I have often felt the same way, saying many funny things without intending to make others laugh, causing many people I have met throughout my life to laugh not only at me but with me. Overall, I don't mind being laughed at. I enjoy it when I make people laugh.

However, despite being able to make others laugh, I often cannot project that ability to bring joy to other people onto myself because I cannot live in the present. As you can see in the painting, Stanczyk is completely lost in his thoughts. The rug beneath his feet is pushed, indicating that he slumped into the chair and stretched out his feet. You can see a crumpled sheet and how his instrument is thrown as if he dropped it when he slumped into the chair. The news was probably devastating.

But how do you make people care about a specific problem or fact when those same people are very focused on escaping reality in other ways? How do you help others focus on reality when your job as a jester is to make others laugh, either at you or with you? Mostly at you...

This is the paradox of the sad clown, which you have probably heard about time and time again. But if not, let me tell you a little more about it because I think it is very, very important...

When I was a child, I once accompanied my mother on one of her trips to Peñón Blanco, a town in Coahuila. My mother used to give this kind of classes; I don't remember the reason, but I went with her. I always enjoyed accompanying my mother because she knew places, and in general, I really liked spending time with her. We had always had a strong connection. On that occasion, we had finished my mother's workday at a party for one of the teachers or students from her class or course. It was a birthday party, and I remember that on that day, while there were activities for children, at the piñata, I tried to fit in and make friends, but I had very little success.

I remember participating, laughing, talking to other children, but it was always difficult for me to be accepted by others. I suppose my name had a lot to do with it, but also my heavy attitude. I don't remember how old I was, but I was still a child. In one of those attempts to fit in, I wanted to participate when the event's entertainer called for it. I don't remember if it was another clown like me or an adult speaking to others to hit the piñata again. I fell to the ground, and although I didn't get hurt, I remember that everyone started laughing at me. At that time, I had already overcome my problem with my feet; I couldn't stand straight, always measured my left foot, and it seemed like I walked crooked. Back then, I used these slippery orthopedic shoes, and unfortunately, that's what caused me to slip and give many people, especially children, a moment of joy.

At that time, being as young as I was, I couldn't bear the humiliation, and I ran out of the event crying because it was very difficult to try to please people who didn't identify with me or didn't want anything to do with me. I was always the "terrorist," "the Muslim," "the foreigner," even though I am Mexican, primarily Spanish-speaking, and an atheist.

I couldn't handle the shame and went out crying, thinking that I would never, ever come back. I tried to go into the forest that was literally a few steps away from where the party was taking place. My mother came out after me, quite angry because she thought I wanted to make a fool of myself. She shouted, "Where are you going, Abdo? Why did you do that?" And I, crying, could only hide my gaze. In addition to the embarrassment, I had the good fortune of encountering a wolf quite close by, maybe it was a very big dog, but I got scared and ran in the opposite direction. My mother tried to calm me down when she saw that I was upset and said, "I thought you did it on purpose" because before the fall, I had been trying to "fit in" like Stanczyk, like a jester!

It should be mentioned that it took me a while to go back to the party because of the shame, but oh surprise, all the children already wanted to play with me. Despite having tears in my eyes, my shame and misfortune automatically made me a carefree person, and I ended up playing a lot of soccer with the others and even sharing candies. The truth is, even though that day was intense, I ended up having a great time because I learned to take myself less seriously. That doesn't mean that nowadays, although I can take myself less seriously and have a gift for making other people laugh in moments of high stress and anxiety, I often find myself with a lost gaze, remembering negative things or reliving traumatic situations that have already passed.

Why can't I make myself laugh sometimes? I remember another situation when I lived in Belgium, where I had a very extreme anxiety attack and ended up calming myself by thinking that if I gave myself a cool haircut, I would look great.I kept cutting and cutting, and I ended up with completely uneven hair. My roommates and friends burst into laughter when they saw me, except for my dear Turkish friend Umur, who exclaimed, "AAAA!" He said, "Tomorrow, after work, I'll take you to a salon to get a proper haircut. You look like a lesbian." I know that back then, it was common to see girls with the same haircut I tried to give myself, which was similar to what is known as a mohawk. I ended up going to work at Winkelhaak in Antwerp, where I lived, and caused quite a laugh. Many people asked me what had happened, and that day I was on fire, making jokes. I said I had cancer but had been cured, that I had lost a bet and let a blind friend cut my hair, that I had a lot of anxiety and ended up tearing my hair out, that someone in training had cut my hair but I didn't want to insult them and let someone else cut my hair, but hey, it was free!

The truth is, that day, I forgot about the difficult time I had when I made the decision to give myself a botched haircut. Although I don't remember taking a photo, I did forget the challenging moments I was going through, living in another country, away from my home, from my own country, for the first time, and experiencing many traumatic situations that are not the subject of the moment, but trust me, I had gone through many traumatizing things up to that point. I can only say that there were many breakups, betrayals, hate, and many goodbyes...

The point I want to make is that every time we have those moments of silence and sadness where we can only stare into space and suffer silently like Stanczyk, disconnected from what is actually happening, they are moments of introspection that, according to Jacques Lacan, are moments when we are connecting with our own identity. By thinking about these traumatic or sad situations, we are reliving the mirror stage. Who am I? What am I doing? Why can't I show anyone how much I am suffering right now? Jacques Lacan said that we humans are made to suffer, and our minds are made to stop suffering. It is no surprise that Stanczyk, unable to project his suffering because his job is to make others laugh, finds himself like me and probably like you, sitting, looking into the void, without making any expression, silently suffering while other people can't stop laughing and enjoying misery in less painful and silent ways.
