When I finished reading the last chapter of "The Gambler" by Fyodor Dostoevsky (translated by Constance Garnett), I was left in a state of shock. The protagonist, Alexei, with his irrational obsessions and self-destructive tendencies, felt eerily familiar. It is this personal connection that I want to explore in this article, as I delve into the novel's themes of addiction, obsession, and self-hatred.

To better visualize these themes, I will reference the works of several renowned painters, all linked by their ability to evoke the raw, human emotions that Dostoevsky so masterfully portrayed in his work.

## The Gambler and his Despair

The novel revolves around Alexei, a young tutor in the employ of a Russian General. Alexei's world begins to unravel when he develops an obsession for Polina, the General's stepdaughter, and an addiction to gambling.

Polina, although dealing with her own struggles, becomes the focus of Alexei's obsession, to the point where he expresses a desire to devour her. This disturbing imagery is reminiscent of Mikhail Vrubel's "The Demon Seated," where the central figure broods with an intense and disturbing inner turmoil.

## An Unexpected Downfall

The turning point of the story occurs with the unexpected arrival of the General's mother, the grandmother of Alexei. This unexpected event dramatically changes the family dynamics and pushes Alexei further into his downward spiral.

The painting "–ù–µ –∂–¥–∞–ª–∏" (Unexpected Visitors) by Ilya Yefimovich Repin perfectly captures this sudden change in fortune. The expressions of shock and despair on the faces of the subjects mirror the emotions experienced by Alexei and the General's family upon the arrival of the grandmother.

## A Descent into Obsession and Addiction

As Alexei descends further into gambling addiction, his love for Polina morphs into an unhealthy obsession. Alexei loses his sense of self-worth, becoming a pawn in the hands of those around him.

_üá≥üá¥ Edvard Munch - Jealousy (1895)_

Edvard Munch's "–†–µ–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å" (Jealousy) illustrates the destructive power of such obsessive feelings. The greenish hue of the painting reflects the jealousy and suspicion that Alexei feels towards other characters, particularly Mr. Astley.

## The Black Square - A Metaphor for Despair

Throughout his journey, Alexei loses everything: friends, love, money, even his country. He's consumed by an abyss of despair, much like the black square in the painting by Kazimir Malevich.

_üá∫üá¶ –ö–∞–∑–∏–º–∏—Ä –ú–∞–ª–µ–≤–∏—á - –ß—ë—Ä–Ω—ã–π –∫–≤–∞–¥—Ä–∞—Ç (Kazimir Malevich - Black Suprematic Square) (1915)_

Malevich's "–ß—ë—Ä–Ω—ã–π –∫–≤–∞–¥—Ä–∞—Ç" (Black Suprematic Square) is a stark representation of a void, a hollow existence, which parallels Alexei's life after he loses everything to his gambling addiction. The painting, much like Alexei's life, is devoid of any decorative or distracting elements. It's a bleak square of blackness, symbolizing the emptiness and despair that takes over Alexei's life.

## The Ruins of an Old House

By the end of the novel, Alexei has become a mere shadow of his former self. He has lost his love, Polina, his wealth, and his respectability. His life is in ruins, much like the old house depicted in the painting by Ivan Kramskoy.

_üá∑üá∫ –ò–≤–∞–Ω –ö—Ä–∞–º—Å–∫–æ–π - –û—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ–≥–æ –¥–æ–º–∞ (Ivan Kramskoy - Inspection of the Old House) (1874)_

Kramskoy's "–û—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ–≥–æ –¥–æ–º–∞" (Inspection of the Old House) serves as a metaphor for Alexei's life at this point. Just like the old, abandoned house in the painting, Alexei's life is in shambles, left to the mercy of his addictions and obsessions.

## Conclusion

Dostoevsky's "The Gambler" is a haunting exploration of the human psyche, addiction, and the destructive power of obsession. Through the character of Alexei, we witness the devastating effects of these issues on an individual's life.

This personal journey into the abyss of addiction and obsession is a stark reminder of the importance of maintaining a healthy balance in our emotional lives. It's a poignant exploration of the human condition, reminding us that while we may feel like champions in our own battles, we must remain vigilant against the potential pitfalls of our own obsessions and addictions.
