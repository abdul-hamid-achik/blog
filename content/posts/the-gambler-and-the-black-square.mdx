When I finished reading the last chapter of "The Gambler" by Fyodor Dostoevsky (translated by Constance Garnett), I was left in a state of shock. The protagonist, Alexei, with his irrational obsessions and self-destructive tendencies, felt eerily familiar. It is this personal connection that I want to explore in this article, as I delve into the novel's themes of addiction, obsession, and self-hatred.

To better visualize these themes, I will reference the works of several renowned painters, all linked by their ability to evoke the raw, human emotions that Dostoevsky so masterfully portrayed in his work.

## The Gambler and his Despair

The novel revolves around Alexei, a young tutor in the employ of a Russian General. Alexei's world begins to unravel when he develops an obsession for Polina, the General's stepdaughter, and an addiction to gambling.

Polina, although dealing with her own struggles, becomes the focus of Alexei's obsession, to the point where he expresses a desire to devour her. This disturbing imagery is reminiscent of Mikhail Vrubel's "The Demon Seated," where the central figure broods with an intense and disturbing inner turmoil.

## An Unexpected Downfall

The turning point of the story occurs with the unexpected arrival of the General's mother, the grandmother of Alexei. This unexpected event dramatically changes the family dynamics and pushes Alexei further into his downward spiral.

The painting "–ù–µ –∂–¥–∞–ª–∏" (Unexpected Visitors) by Ilya Yefimovich Repin perfectly captures this sudden change in fortune. The expressions of shock and despair on the faces of the subjects mirror the emotions experienced by Alexei and the General's family upon the arrival of the grandmother.

## A Descent into Obsession and Addiction

As Alexei descends further into gambling addiction, his love for Polina morphs into an unhealthy obsession. Alexei loses his sense of self-worth, becoming a pawn in the hands of those around him.

_üá≥üá¥ Edvard Munch - Jealousy (1895)_

Edvard Munch's "–†–µ–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å" (Jealousy) illustrates the destructive power of such obsessive feelings. The greenish hue of the painting reflects the jealousy and suspicion that Alexei feels towards other characters, particularly Mr. Astley.

## The Black Square - A Metaphor for Despair

Throughout his journey, Alexei loses everything: friends, love, money, even his country. He's consumed by an abyss of despair, much like the black square in the painting by Kazimir Malevich.

_üá∫üá¶ Kazimir Malevich - Black Suprematic Square (1915)_

Malevich's "–ß—ë—Ä–Ω—ã–π –∫–≤–∞–¥—Ä–∞—Ç" (Black Suprematic Square) is a stark representation of a void, a hollow existence, which parallels Alexei's life after he loses everything to his gambling addiction. The painting, much like Alexei's life, is devoid of any decorative or distracting elements. It's a bleak square of blackness, symbolizing the emptiness and despair that takes over Alexei's life.

## The Ruins of an Old House

By the end of the novel, Alexei has become a mere shadow of his former self. He has lost his love, Polina, his wealth, and his respectability. His life is in ruins, much like the old house depicted in the painting by Ivan Kramskoy.

Kramskoy's "–û—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ–≥–æ –¥–æ–º–∞" (Inspection of the Old House) serves as a metaphor for Alexei's life at this point. Just like the old, abandoned house in the painting, Alexei's life is in shambles, left to the mercy of his addictions and obsessions.

## Conclusion

Dostoevsky's "The Gambler" is a haunting exploration of the human psyche, addiction, and the destructive power of obsession. Through the character of Alexei, we witness the devastating effects of these issues on an individual's life.

This personal journey into the abyss of addiction and obsession is a stark reminder of the importance of maintaining a healthy balance in our emotional lives. It's a poignant exploration of the human condition, reminding us that while we may feel like champions in our own battles, we must remain vigilant against the potential pitfalls of our own obsessions and addictions.

My rating: [5 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4592870021)

Dostoevsky's "The Gambler" is a profound exploration of the human psyche, illuminating the darkest corners of obsession and addiction. The protagonist, Alexei, is a complex character who is ultimately undone by his own irrationalities and self-destructive tendencies.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, we witness Alexei's transformation from a man entangled in his unrequited love for Polina to a desperate gambler who, in the throes of his addiction, loses everything that ever mattered. His interactions with Mr. Astley, who reveals to Alexei that Polina indeed loved him, expose the depth of Alexei's denial and self-hatred. Despite this revelation, Alexei continues to gamble, demonstrating the severity of his addiction.<br /><br />Alexei's character resonated deeply with me. His struggle with self-love and his constant need for validation from those who could hurt him the most was both heart-wrenching and illuminating. The way he hands the keys to his emotional wellbeing over to others, particularly Polina, and allows himself to be trapped in his obsessions was a devastating depiction of the consequences of addictive behavior.<br /><br />Polina, though somewhat enigmatic, is a character who has her own set of trials. The fact that she retains her emotional distance from Alexei, not willing to be pulled into his vortex of self-destruction, adds another layer of complexity to their relationship.<br /><br />The most tragic aspect of the novel is Alexei's inability to escape from the cycle of addiction, even when he learns of Polina's love for him and her newfound wealth. It's a stark reminder of the power that addiction can have over a person's life, causing them to lose sight of what truly matters.<br /><br />The novel is filled with poignant quotes, but one that particularly struck me was along the lines of, "One has never won anything in his life but yet he felt like a champion every day." This phrase encapsulates the tragedy of Alexei's life ‚Äì a man who, despite his continuous losses, persists in a destructive path that he believes will lead him to victory.<br /><br />"The Gambler" is a deeply emotional, thought-provoking novel that offers a stark glimpse into the perils of addiction and the destructive power of obsession. It's a journey that's as distressing as it is enlightening, and one that will stay with me for a long time.
