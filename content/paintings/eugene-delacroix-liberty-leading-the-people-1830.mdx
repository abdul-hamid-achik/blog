Eugène Delacroix painted "Liberty Leading the People" in 1830, just months after the July Revolution toppled Charles X and his attempts to dissolve parliament and restrict the press. What makes this painting endure is not just its technical brilliance — the diagonal surge of bodies, the smoke, the tricolor held high — but its honesty about who actually shows up when history demands it. Look at the figures around Marianne: a factory worker, a student with pistols, a street kid with guns too big for his hands, a man in a top hat who might be a bourgeois intellectual or Delacroix himself. This is not a painting of generals. It is a painting of the crowd.

The French revolutionary tradition — from 1789 through 1830 to the Paris Commune of 1871 — was the crucible in which modern political thought was forged. Karl Marx watched these upheavals with obsessive attention. He lived in Paris, studied the mechanics of French class conflict, and drew from it the conclusion that revolution was not an accident of history but a recurring structural event. When he wrote that "the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles," he was, in large part, writing about what Delacroix had already painted: the moment when the contradictions of a society become unbearable and people take to the streets.

What Delacroix captured, perhaps without fully intending to, is the composition of a revolutionary class. Marianne is an allegory, but the men around her are not. They are specific social types, united temporarily by a shared enemy. Marx would later theorize this exact phenomenon — the alliance of classes that makes revolution possible, and the fractures that emerge the moment the old regime falls. The bourgeoisie and the proletariat march together in 1830; by 1848, they are on opposite sides of the barricade.

There is something deeply moving about this painting's refusal to sanitize revolution. The dead lie in the foreground, half-dressed and broken. Liberty herself is barefoot and battle-stained. Delacroix does not ask you to admire revolution from a safe distance — he puts you in the smoke and the noise.
