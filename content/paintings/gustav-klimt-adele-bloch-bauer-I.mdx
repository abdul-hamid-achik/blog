Adele Bloch-Bauer I is a painting by the master Gustav Klimt, a prominent member of the Vienna Secession movement. Klimt's primary subject was the female body, and his works are marked by a frank eroticism. The painting depicts Adele Bloch-Bauer, a wealthy society woman and the wife of Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, a Jewish banker and sugar producer. The golden attire and intricate detail reflect Klimt's fascination with Byzantine mosaics and Egyptian symbols, while Adele's indifferent and slightly sad expression may suggest the emptiness of material wealth. This paradox of the golden woman is a theme I explore in depth in my blocked page <Link href="/blocked">Congratulations, You've Struck Gold!</Link>.
