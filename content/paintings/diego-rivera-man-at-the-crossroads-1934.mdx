In 1933, Nelson Rockefeller commissioned Diego Rivera to paint a mural in the lobby of 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City. The subject was to be optimistic: "Man at the Crossroads Looking with Hope and High Vision to the Choosing of a New and Better Future." Rivera, a committed Marxist who had never hidden his politics, accepted the commission and proceeded to paint exactly what he believed. When Rockefeller's people noticed a portrait of Lenin appearing in the mural, they asked Rivera to remove it. He refused. They paid him his fee, covered the mural with canvas, and in February 1934, destroyed it entirely. Rivera's response was to repaint the work — larger and more defiant — at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, under the new title "Man, Controller of the Universe."

The mural is structured as a choice. At its center, a worker sits at the controls of a great machine, hands on the levers of history. To one side, the world of capitalism: war, police violence, the idle rich, disease spreading through decadence. To the other, the world of socialism: workers united, Lenin clasping hands across nations, the promise of collective labor and scientific progress. Rivera was not interested in subtlety. He painted ideology the way an architect draws a blueprint — with total conviction that the structure could be built.

What makes this mural extraordinary is not just its politics but its story. A billionaire paid a Marxist to decorate his building, and when the Marxist painted Marxism, the billionaire destroyed the art rather than let it speak. Rivera understood something essential: that art in public spaces is a form of power, and that the ruling class will tolerate dissent in galleries but not in lobbies. The destruction of the Rockefeller mural was not censorship in the usual sense — it was class warfare conducted with sledgehammers.

The fact that Rivera simply painted it again, bigger and better, in his own country, is one of the great acts of artistic defiance in the twentieth century. The mural still stands in the Palacio de Bellas Artes, free and open to the public.
