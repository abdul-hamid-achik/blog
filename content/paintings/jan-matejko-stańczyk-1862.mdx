Stańczyk is a painting by the master Jan Matejko that deeply impacts me. The painting depicts a jester, Stańczyk, who despite his role to entertain and bring joy to others, is unable to find happiness himself. This paradox of the sad clown is a theme I explore in depth in my blog post <Link href="/posts/stanczky-and-the-paradox-of-the-sad-clown">Stańczyk and the Paradox of the Sad Clown</Link>.
