Hello, I'm Abdul Hamid, a seasoned Senior Full Stack Developer based in Guadalajara, Mexico. I'm always ready to take on new challenges and explore new technologies.

Beyond my professional commitments, which you can follow on my [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/abdulachik/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/abdul-hamid-achik), I am an avid reader with a particular interest in psychoanalysis and authors like Jacques Lacan and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. You can find my reading list [here](https://www.goodreads.com/abdulhamidachik).

I'm fluent in English and Spanish, with basic knowledge of Russian and Arabic. I identify as a Lacanian atheist liberal, a perspective that informs my approach to life and work.

This website serves as a platform for me to share my insights, experiences, and stories. I aim to entertain, educate, and learn alongside my readers through a mix of technical posts, reflections on literature and philosophy, and personal narratives.

If you have any questions, want to chat, or wish to book some time to talk with me, don't hesitate to reach out to me at goad.00potions@icloud.com or schedule a meeting through [Cal](https://cal.com/abdulachik/30min).

Feel free to explore!
