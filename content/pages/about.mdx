title: About me
description: Hello, I'm Abdul Hamid, an experienced Senior Full Stack Developer based in Guadalajara, Mexico. I'm always ready to take on new challenges and explore new technologies.

Beyond my professional commitments, which you can follow on my [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/abdulachik/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/abdul-hamid-achik), I'm an avid reader with a particular interest in psychoanalysis and authors like Jacques Lacan and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. You can find my reading list [here](https://www.goodreads.com/abdulhamidachik).

I speak fluent English and Spanish, with basic knowledge of Russian and Arabic. I identify as a Lacanian atheist liberal, a perspective that informs my approach to life and work.

This website serves as a platform to share my ideas, experiences, and stories. My goal is to entertain, educate, and learn alongside my readers through a mix of technical posts, reflections on literature and philosophy, and personal narratives.

If you have any questions, want to chat, or wish to book a time to speak with me, don't hesitate to contact me at [my email](mailto:goad.00potions@icloud.com) or schedule a meeting through [Cal](https://cal.com/abdulachik/30min).

Feel free to explore!
