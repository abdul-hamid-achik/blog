# Posts over time

This chart shows the number of posts published over time. The data is fetched using a GraphQL query defined in `components/charts.tsx` which retrieves the `postsOverTime` field from the GraphQL server. Each data point represents a month and the number of posts published in that month.

# Reading time distribution

This chart shows the distribution of reading times for all posts. The data is fetched using a GraphQL query defined in `components/charts.tsx` which retrieves the `readingTimeDistribution` field from the GraphQL server. Each data point represents a category of reading time (e.g., "1-2 minutes", "2-3 minutes", etc.) and the number of posts that fall into that category.

The GraphQL server's schema is defined in `/api/graphql`. The `PostsOverTime` and `ReadingTimeDistribution` types are part of this schema. `PostsOverTime` has two fields: `month` (a string representing the month) and `count` (an integer representing the number of posts). `ReadingTimeDistribution` also has two fields: `category` (a string representing the reading time category) and `count` (an integer representing the number of posts in that category).
